# About WE Rocketry

Welcome to the Western Engineering Rocketry Team (WERT), a passionate, student-led engineering team at Western University in London, Ontario, Canada. Since our founding in 2016, we have dedicated ourselves to the innovation, design, and launch of high-powered rockets for the Intercollegiate Rocket Engineering Competition (IREC) at the Spaceport America Cup—the world’s largest intercollegiate rocketry competition.

## Our Mission

Our mission is simple: to push the boundaries of rocketry through hands-on engineering, collaboration, and ingenuity. Every year, we design and build rockets from scratch, focusing on cutting-edge technology and craftsmanship. From advanced avionics systems to homemade carbon fiber structures, we take pride in our ability to create rockets that soar.

## Subteams

Our team is divided into specialized subteams, each focusing on different aspects of the rocket:

- **Aerostructure**: Responsible for the design and manufacturing of the rocket’s body and structural components.
- **Propulsion**: Develops and tests propulsion systems, including the engines that power our rockets.
- **Avionics**: Designs electronic systems that control flight and collect data throughout the mission.
- **Recovery**: Ensures the safe return of our rockets using parachutes and recovery systems.
- **Payload**: Focuses on scientific experiments and cargo integration to ensure successful delivery and data collection.

## Achievements

Our team continues to reach new milestones every year. During the 2022-2024 season, we:
- Successfully launched rockets at the Spaceport America Cup.
- Ranked 41st out of 93 teams during our first appearance at the competition.
- Developed groundbreaking rockets using advanced materials like carbon fiber and innovative avionics systems.
